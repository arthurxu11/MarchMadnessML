## Using Machine Learning to predict March Madness brackets! ##

This is an machine learning script that can predict March Madness brackets using Python and Scikit.

### Technology Summary ###
* Python
* Scikit
* Pandas

## Results ##

The algorithm seems to underestimate teams, rarely giving out predictions of 4 or above. However, if you order the teams by their prediction, it creates a very good ranking.
If the algorithm predicted the 2019 March Madness bracket, it would have scored in the 98th percentile of all brackets!
